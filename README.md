# Asylum-Seekers

## Introduction

Welcome to the Asylum-Seekers repository! This project is the culmination of the final project for the Statistical Computing course (STAT292). Utilizing RShiny, the project offers a comprehensive exploration of asylum application data sourced from the UNHCR Population Statistics database. It encompasses data visualization, exploration, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms tailored for regression tasks.

## About the Data

The data provided in this repository has been sourced from the UNHCR Population Statistics database. It offers insights into asylum applications lodged in nearly 200 countries worldwide spanning the years 2000 to 2014. The dataset is granular, breaking down information by month and country of origin.

The populations of concern tracked by the UNHCR encompass refugees, asylum-seekers, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), stateless persons, and other individuals who may not fit into these categories but are extended protection and assistance services by the UNHCR based on humanitarian or other special grounds.

Sources for this data include the UNHCR Population Statistics and UNHCR Populations of Concern databases.

## Usage

This repository provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and analysts interested in understanding global trends in asylum-seeking behavior and the demographics of asylum-seekers worldwide. The dataset can be utilized for various purposes, including academic research, policy analysis, and humanitarian efforts.

The RShiny project contained within offers interactive data visualization and exploration tools, along with the implementation of machine learning algorithms specifically designed for regression tasks. Users can leverage these features to gain deeper insights into asylum application trends and demographics.
