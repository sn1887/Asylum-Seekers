# Asylum-Seekers

ABOUT THE Data

In response to the growing need for empirical insights into the experiences of asylum seekers, our project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset using RShiny, a web application framework in R. Through this endeavor, and we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of asylum migration dynamics, exploring patterns, trends, and potential predictors of asylum outcomes.

UNHCR's populations of concern include refugees, asylum-seekers, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), stateless persons, and individuals who do not necessarily fall directly into any of the groups above but to whom UNHCR extends its protection and assistance services based on humanitarian or other special grounds.

Sources include UNHCR Population Statistics and UNHCR Populations of Concern.

Our interactive application offers seamless access to a vast repository of over 100,000 data points spanning 14 variables across a 15-year timeframe. Our endeavor extends beyond mere data dissemination; it aims to serve as a resource for individuals seeking to deepen their understanding of this pressing humanitarian issue.


We provide a range of services: from smart searching and exploration of the data, to easy to understand visuals (including maps, plots and Machine-Learning models).
