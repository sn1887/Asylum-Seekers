# Asylum-Seekers

ABOUT THE Data

This data was acquired from the UNHCR Population Statistics database. It presents information about asylum applications lodged in almost 200 countries across the globe between the years 2000 and 2014. Data are broken down by month and country of origin.

UNHCR's populations of concern include refugees, asylum-seekers, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), stateless persons, and individuals who do not necessarily fall directly into any of the groups above but to whom UNHCR extends its protection and assistance services based on humanitarian or other special grounds.

Sources include UNHCR Population Statistics and UNHCR Populations of Concern.
